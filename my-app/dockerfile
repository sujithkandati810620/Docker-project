# Step 1: Use an official Node.js runtime as a parent image
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the package.json and package-lock.json to the container
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the React app
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Use a smaller base image for the final step
FROM node:18-alpine

# Step 8: Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 9: Copy the build output from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/build /app/build

# Step 10: Install a simple HTTP server
RUN npm install -g serve

# Step 11: Expose the port the app will run on
EXPOSE 3000

# Step 12: Start the app using the simple HTTP server
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build", "-l", "3000"]
